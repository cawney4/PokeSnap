# PokeSnap

This game is a ripoff of Pokemon Snap, but we're attempting to make it in VR. The general idea of the game is the player sits in a moving cart and takes pictures of animals that are all around him/her.

This project was created for PennApps XVI, although we did not complete it on time.

The game was created in Unity, and we are working with Gear VR.
